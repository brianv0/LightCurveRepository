# Fermi-LAT Light Curve Repository

The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) Light Curve Repository is designed to display multi-cadence likelihood light curves for all variable sources in the Fermi-LAT 10 year point source catalog (4FGL - Abdollahi et al. 2020).  

This repository represents the HTML & Javascript front end of the Light Curve Repository. A deployed version of the code in this repository can be found at the Fermi Science Support Center hosted at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.
